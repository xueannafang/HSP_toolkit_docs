# Candidate selection checklist

To make the prediction more efficient for target application, we recommend a careful selection of solvent candidates based on your target applications.

We classifies the following situations and practical considerations:

## Synthesis

- Please check the safety data sheet carefully, especially incompatible chemicals co-existing in your target application before planning your reaction.
- Could the solvent compete with your other reactant and participate in the reaction? Do they contain similar reactive sites?
- Is there any restriction on pH? (We recommend check your reaction mechanism.)
- If you are quenching you reaction with another solvent, would these candidates be [miscible](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/technical-documents/technical-article/analytical-chemistry/purification/solvent-miscibility-table) with the solvent to quench your reaction?

## Post-synthesis

- What is the workup plan?
- If you want to do a filtration: Would these candidates be miscible with your washing solvents?
- How is your product solubility? (We recommend a solubility test after the first batch of reaction under standard conditions. This can help preventing transporting your product into the discard phase, and will help planning your workup procedure.)
- Would you need to remove your solvent in vacuo? If so, make sure the vapour pressure and boiling point are addressed. Note that certain combinations can also form [azeotrope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope_tables).


## Characterisation

- We recommned to discuss potential restriction with the staff operating related facilities.
- What is the restriction on the instrument? For example, TEM may require additional drying step if hexane is applied. HPLC, NMR, ESI, may also have a limited candidate options available. 
- Is there any requirement on hydrophobicity and contacting condition with your sample holder? The hydrophobicity of solvents and solute can together determine the appropriate sample holder materials for certain techniques.
- Would that technique prefer volatile or non-volatile solvents?
- For MALDI: how is the compatibility between the matrix and solvent?
- Is there any concern on the swellability of sample container? You may need to choose the correct material for the container if aggressive solvents are applied.
