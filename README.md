# Introduction

## Aim

The aim of this project is to develop quantitative solvent selection tools for synthesis and property control of functional materials. The focus is based on Hansen solubility parameters (HSP).

## HSP

HSP decompose the molecular interaction into dispersion (𝜹𝑫), dipolar (𝜹𝑷) and hydrogen-bonding (𝜹𝑯) interactions.

Solubility can be quantified by the Hansen distance (R). HSP of a solvent mixture follows a linear combination of its components, which greatly expands options based on given lab solvents.

## Challenges

There are nevertheless a couple of challenges when using HSP:

1. Determining which solvent combinations can lead to a given HSP.

2. Obtaining HSP of the studied materials (M), especially for complicated systems without a clear understanding of structure, e.g., amorphous polymers.

## Solutions

To improve these issues, we developed two python-based toolkits:

1. *Solvent Predictor (SolvPred)*:
- Based on the target Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs), propose a list of multi-solvent combination.

Given that HSP of a solvent mixture follows a linear combination of each individual component, researchers can easily calculate the HSP of solvent systems with known components. It is however much more difficult to reverse this process.

 </p>

The aim of *SolvPred* is to support the solvent suggestion when a desired goal of HSP is known.

The key function is to convert the target HSP into a multi-solvent list based on the requirement of user.

 </p>

 Advanced property filtration could be avilable depending on users preference.


2. *M Locator (MLoc)*:
- Predict HSPs of the studied material based on an experimental-measurable solubility score.

 <!-- <p>

 </p> -->

As indicated by its name, *MLoc* locates "*M*" in the Hansen space.

It is a top-down approach aiming at obtaining the HSP of as-studied material (M) using a solubility score (*w<sub>i</sub>*) measured from a series of solvents.

*MLoc* can be useful for complicated systems whose exact chemical component is hard to confirm. This could be, for example, polymeric systems with high dispersity, mixtures of isomers or analogous, etc., where bottom-up method like group contribution may not be easy to be carried out.

  </p>

Part of the *MLoc* can be connected to *SolvPred* to provide multi-solvent suggestion based on the as-predicted HSP of the material.

The solubility indicator applied in the prototype version is based on UV-Vis spectroscoy features. User can specify their own indicator (served as the weight function).

The studied materials tested during the development of *MLoc* are mainly based on [conjugated microporous polymers (CMP)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/conjugated-microporous-polymer).
